# Algorithm Project

## Overview
This project implements interactive animations for two classic problems in computer science: the Eight Queens problem and the Graph Coloring problem. Both algorithms utilize backtracking techniques to find solutions, and the animations provide a visual representation of the algorithm's process.

## Features
- **Eight Queens Problem**: Visualizes the placement of queens on a chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The animation demonstrates the backtracking process as it explores potential placements and backtracks upon conflicts.
- **Graph Coloring Problem**: Illustrates the process of coloring a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The animation shows how the algorithm attempts to color the graph and backtracks when it encounters conflicts.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the interactive animations.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the animations.
3. Observe how the algorithms work step-by-step through the visual representation.
